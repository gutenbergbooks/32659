<h2>An Answer to a late scurrillous Pamphlet, Intituled,
<i>A Letter from Monsieur</i> de Cros, <i>&amp;c.</i></h2>


<p>The Author of the <i>Memoirs</i> had so little to apprehend in his
Reputation either at home or abroad from the feeble Efforts of
<i>Monsieur de Cross</i> in his late trifling <i>Invective</i>, that had it not
been for the repeated Instances of some Friends, who were unwilling
to have such a wretched Scribler escape unpunished, he had never
condescended to the severe penance of sitting an hour upon him. To
their Importunities, and not to his own Inclinations is the Reader
obliged for the following <i>Remarks</i>, which as they serve to justifie
those particular passages in the <i>Memoirs</i> that are so outrageously
exclaimed against by Mr. <i>de Cros</i>, so they discover, <i>en passant</i>,
several Intrigues hitherto not so well known or understood.</p>

<p>Though we may safely allow it to be some sort of Mortificatioa for any
one to see himself lie under the lash of a Man of Wit; yet certainly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>'tis infinitely more supportable than to be assaulted by a Malice
altogether made up of Phlegm and Dulness. <i>&AElig;ne&aelig; magni dextr&acirc; cadis</i>,
was said by way of Consolation to young <i>Lausus</i> as he fell by the
hands of that celebrated Heroe. When we lie under an unavoidable
necessity of being encountered in Publick, 'tis some Comfort to be
engaged with Bravery and Honour: In such a Case there is Reputation to
be got if we come off with Victory; but to be forced to enter the
Lists with a feeble, inglorious and despicable Adversary, is somewhat
afflicting; there can be no Skill, no Dexterity shown in putting by
his Thrusts, and there is no Reputation acquired by gaining the
Conquest.</p>

<p>Certainly there never appeared in the World a Paper so little
performing what it seems to promise in the Title page, so mean and
undesigning, and in short so below the mighty Character of its Author
who so often takes care to instruct us that <i>a great Prince and a King
did not disdain to employ him as a Counsellor of State</i>, as this
rambling, incoherent unthinking Letter. But perhaps it may be alledged
by some of its Favourers, that the sincerity of what it pretends to
relate, may atone for all its other palpable defects, since to use his
own magnificent Expression our Deserter of a <i>Monk</i> is pleased to
assure us, <i>p. 9.</i> that <i>the only Heroe of his Piece shall be Truth</i>:
And indeed the Matter wou'd be somewhat mended if the Case were so;
but for certain Considerations best known to himself our Letter-Writer
has been so complaisant to his Heroe, as not to give him any trouble
at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> all. However this pleasant passage puts me in mind of a certain
person of the Long Robe who a little after the Restauration, when
writing of Plays was more in fashion than it is at present, must needs
threaten the Stage with a Play; and as a Hero is a very necessary
Ingredient in all or at least most Compositions of that Nature, he
designed to furnish himself with a Hero that should work Miracles,
defeat Armies, charm the Ladies, and make as considerable a Figure as
any Hero that had visited the World for many Ages. After he had amused
himself some Months with this painful Undertaking, a Friend of his
happens to interrogate him upon this Article, and asks him what
Progress he had made in his Play, and how his Hero fared. To which the
poor Gentleman replied, that a certain Misfortune had befallen him
which had put a stop to the Affair. In short, after a tedious Enquiry,
he informs him that he had unluckily killed his Hero in the first Act,
and so cou'd not for the heart of him tell how to advance any farther.
This was fairly and civilly done in our Gentleman. He had cut out so
much Work for his Hero in the first Act, that he had left him nothing
to do in any of the rest; and therefore was obliged to dispatch him in
his own defence; but Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> never so much as introduces
his Hero in one single Paragraph of his Letter: He threatens indeed to
bring him in Play one time or another, but for all that keeps him
still as invisible as a Fairy Treasure, and his Hero has no more to do
throughout the whole piece, than one of the <i>Mut&aelig; Person&aelig;</i> in the
ancient <i>Drama</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> is pleased to address his Letter to a certain Noble
Lord in <i>Nubibus</i>; for he no where takes occasion to name him, and
this was certainly done with no other Prospect than only to recommend
his Trifle the better to his Readers. He owns, <i>p. 3.</i> that <i>Sir</i>
W. T. <i>is a Man of some Merit, and that he has been employed a long time
upon very important Affairs</i>, but then with his usual Confidence
affirms that <i>he knew very little of the Secret of the late King of</i>
England's <i>Designs</i>. Sir <i>W. T.</i> no where pretends in his Memoirs
that he knew the bottom of all the Court-Intrigues, that were managed
with so much Artifice by the prevailing Ministry of those times; nay
he congratulates his good Fortune that he was never made acquainted
with them; and though from several remarkable Circumstances he has all
the Reason imaginable to suspect that some things were not so fairly
meant as was openly pretended, yet he knows no Reason why they should
not trust him in any Occasions wherein the Honour of his Master or the
true Interest of the Kingdom were concerned: And as for the rest, he
thinks it the highest Complement the Ministry ever made him, not to
disclose them to him.</p>

<p>Upon this Consideration says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 4. <i>I had no great
Curiosity to peruse the Memoirs, well judging that the Author was not
able to give me any tolerable Light into the discovery of so many
secret Intrigues that were carried on at that juncture: And besides</i>,
continues he, <i>I had Reason to doubt whether these Memoirs were not
principally designed to be a Panegyrick upon himself,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
<i>and to blacken the Reputation of several Persons of eminent Quality and Merit,
because</i>, adds he, <i>I was particularly acquainted with the Pride of
Sir</i> W. T. <i>who fansies himself to be the wisest and ablest Politician
of his Age.</i> If Sir <i>W. T.</i> is that vainglorious and ill-natured
Animal as Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> represents him to be, he here solemnly
promises him that he will never come to him to learn either Humility
or good Manners; and if he has been severe upon any of the Great Men
then in Vogue, he has done no more than what every Body almost in the
Nation has done since. He barely contents himself with the
Satisfaction of having been in some measure serviceable to his King
and Country; and since he has not made his Fortunes at the expence of
either, he supposes he may lawfully mention his Services without the
horrid Crime of Ostentation or Vanity.</p>

<p>But to let the World see that Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has no Malice in his
Heart, but that he really designs Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Good, he condescends p.
5. to give him wholesome Advice, and sets him Copies to write after.
To this purpose he recommends to his Perusal <i>the Memoirs of</i>
Villeroy, <i>the Negotiations of</i> Jeanin, <i>and the Letters of Cardinal</i>
Dossat, <i>in all which there reigns a Spirit of Sincerity and
Modesty</i>. Sir <i>W. T.</i> never presum'd to set himself in Competition
with any of those illustrious Persons; he is no Stranger to their
Merits or Character, but is afraid that Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has
proposed some Models to him which he never intends to follow himself.
It was not Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Bookseller that called him <i>One of</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<i>the greatest Men of this Age</i>, as Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> falsely insinuates,
<i>p. 5.</i> but a reverend Prelate of our Church, who published the
<i>Memoirs</i> without the Author's Consent or Privity; and who, in his
Advertisement to the Reader, does not stile him <i>Un des Grands Hommes
de ce Siecle</i>, as Monsieur <i>du Cros</i> maliciously has printed it, but
only <i>an Ornament to Learning and to his Country</i>: So that this being
a Mystery to no body in <i>England</i>, he wonders how some People come to
make such Blunders about it in <i>Holland</i>. But by this and several
Instances of the like Nature, any man may easily guess what famous
Exploits Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> designs to perform with the Help of his
<i>Hero</i>.</p>

<p>To make good the Charge of Presumption with which Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>
taxes the Author of the Memoirs, he cites a Passage, <i>p. 6.</i> which be
found accidentally at the first opening of his Book; and assures his
Noble Lord, that he doubts not but he shall be able in a short time to
produce several others to the same Effect. <i>The Negotiations which I
had managed at the</i> Hague, <i>at</i> Brussels, <i>and at</i> Aix la Chappelle,
<i>and saved</i> Flanders <i>out of the hands of France in 1668, made them
believe that I had some Credit amongst the</i> Spaniards, <i>as well as in</i>
Holland. Indeed, as he has cited this Passage, any one would
believe, that all the Glory and Merit of Preserving <i>Flanders</i> was
intirely owing to Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Conduct; and with this wrong Scent
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> runs along very furiously, talks of erecting
Statues, of the Ingratitude of <i>Spain</i> and <i>Holland</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
with abundance of other bitter things, with which his Indignation plentifully
furnishes him at all times. But our Comfort is, that this Passage is
nothing near so criminal and arrogant in the Original as our
Letter-monger would have it; and therefore it may not be <i>mal &agrave;
propos</i> to cite it fairly. <a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a><i>This
I suppose gave some Occasion for
my being again design'd for this Ambassy, who was thought to have some
Credit with</i> Spain <i>as well as</i> Holland, <i>from the Negotiations I had
formerly run through at the</i> Hague, Brussels, <i>and</i> Aix la
Chapelle, <i>by which the remaining Parts of</i> Flanders <i>had been saved
out of the Hands of</i> France <i>in the Year 1668.</i> In the first Citation
it looks as if Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Management of the Treaty had wholly
occasioned the Preservation of <i>Flanders</i>, whereas in the latter, if
it meets with a true Construction, nothing more is meant, but that the
Negotiations at the abovementioned Places, in which Sir <i>W. T.</i> had
his share amongst the other Ministers that acted there, retrieved
<i>Flanders</i> from ruin. If we may believe Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, he will
positively tell us <i>p. 8. that all the Merit and Glory of the Peace
as well as of the Triple League, ought in justice to be ascribed to
the generous Resolution and Constancy of the States-General, who
employ'd, upon this Occasion, a Minister who far surpassed Sir W. T.
in Prudence, in Experience and all Abilities</i>. Sir <i>W. T.</i> has nothing
to quarrel with Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> for upon this last Article; (tho,
as he is sure, no one is the worse for his Calumnies, so he thinks no
one is the better for his Commendations,) nor is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>he insensible what a
generous Part the States-General acted at this important Conjuncture,
when the publick Repose of all <i>Europe</i> so much depended upon their
Resolutions and Conduct: Only he thinks it hard that <i>England</i> should
not be allowed the least Share in the Turn of these Affairs, and that
the Ministers of so powerful a Crown should be passed over in Silence
without any Mention or Acknowledgement, as if they had been reckoned
abroad for so many Cyphers.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A" id="Footnote_A"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A"><span class="label">[A]</span></a>
<i>Memoirs</i>, p. 30.</p></div>

<p>After this Fit of Passion is over, the Weather begins to clear up with
our Author, and, during this Interval, he makes bold to acquaint his
Lordship, p. 8. <i>that he does by no means design in this Place to
examine Sir</i> W. T'<i>s Memoirs to the Bottom; No, he will take some
better Opportunity for that, and then, if God spares him with Life and
Health, he fairly promises him a Volume of Remarks, at least as big as
Sir</i> W. T'<i>s Book</i>. Those Persons that are never so little vers'd in
the true Character of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, need not be informed that he
promises mighty things, and performs just nothing at all. This unlucky
shifting off his Resentments to a fitter Occasion, (tho 'tis certain
he can never meet with a more proper one to unload himself of them)
looks like making Exceptions to the Ground when a man is to meet his
Adversary with his Sword in his Hand in the Field. In common Prudence
he ought to have acquitted one part of the Debt now, and then the
World would have been so civil as to have taken his Word for the
Payment of the rest. However let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> this terrible Day come as soon as it
will, Sir <i>W. T.</i> is under no Agonies at the thought of it: For let
our Monsieur scribble a Cart-load of Books if he pleases, 'tis a sad
but undeniable Truth, that 'tis in his Power to injure no man
breathing by them but only his Bookseller.</p>

<p><i>Had I the Vanity like him</i>, says the modest, self-denying Monsieur
<i>de Cros</i>, p. 8. <i>to print my Memoirs in my Life-time, I have now a
very fair Pretence to do it.</i> Well, certainly there never dropt in
this World so unwary a Passage as this from the Pen of a Counsellor of
State and all that! For who will now be ever brought to believe that
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> is acquainted with the Intrigues of other People,
and consequently in a Capacity of writing Memoirs, who is a meer
Stranger at Home, and so utterly unacquainted with himself. <i>If I had
the Vanity</i>; No, never fear it, do but consult a certain thing called
a Looking-Glass every Morning, and thou mayst with a safe Conscience
say <i>good morrow</i> to one of the compleatest Pieces of Vanity in the
Universe. But once more, <i>If I had the Vanity like him</i>, meaning Sir
<i>W. T.</i> What Occasion Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> had to pubblish so unjust and
invidious a Calumny, no body can tell but himself; for had he
consulted either the Reverend Publisher's Epistle to the Reader, or
Sir <i>W. T.</i>'s to his Son, or lastly maintained any manner of
Correspondence with his old Acquaintance in <i>England</i>, it had been
impossible for him to make so gross, so unpardonable a Mistake. All or
any of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> must certainly have convinced him that Sir <i>W. T.</i> knew
no more of the publishing of the Memoirs than his ungenerous Adversary
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>.</p>

<p>Well, but to pursue him in his Reveries; <i>I should publish</i>, says our
mortal Foe to Vanity, p. 9. <i>juster and more solid Memoirs than Sir</i>
W. T. <i>has done, if I had any Inclinations to appear in Print</i>; and
yet to see what a strange Spirit of Contradiction possesses some
people, he adds in the very next Lines that follow, <i>Not that I have
the Presumption to imagine my self more capable of performing such an
Undertaking than He is</i>. In the first place he proclaims it to all
Mankind, that he is fitter to write just and solid things than Sir
<i>W. T.</i> and secondly, before the Words are well out of his Mouth, he
would not be guilty of so much presumption as to think himself better
qualified for such an Undertaking than Sir <i>W. T.</i> If there be any
meaning in this sensless inconsistent passage, it amounts only to
this, <i>viz.</i> That 'tis possible for a Man to write more justly and
solidly than another (as for instance Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> (if you'll
take his own Word for it) can write more justly and solidly than Sir
<i>W. T.</i>) and yet after all, with these two Qualifications, is not
capable of writing better than he that has neither of them. Writing
<i>justly</i> and <i>solidly</i> are none of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s Talents; and
therefore he was resolved to be revenged upon them.</p>

<p>What follows is extremely surprizing. <i>Whenever I put Pen to Paper</i>,
says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 9. <i>I will write without Complaisance,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<i>without Flattery, without Passion</i>: 'Tis strange he did not add
<i>without Sence and Meaning</i>. No doubt but Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> will
write without Complaisance let him begin when he will; so far we
readily believe him: But that he will ever be persuaded to renounce
two of the dearest Qualities about him, Flattery and Passion, is
somewhat hard to digest. 'Tis true he promises fine things all along,
but is still so unkind to himself as to give us but very small hopes
that he'll remember to be as good as his Word. And 'tis very natural
for the censorious World not to regard what a Man promises, especially
if he does not regard them himself. In this small inconsiderable
Letter, as short as it is, he has taken care to exercise both his
Flattery and his Passion; and if it was impossible for him to write
four Sheets without calling them both to his Assistance, can it be
supposed he can write threescore without a spice of them? Nay,
continues the sweet-tempered Monsieur <i>de Cross</i>, <i>I will not express
the least Passion, no, not so much as against Sir</i> W. T. <i>but will do
him the kindness to instruct him in abundance of things, which he poor
Man has executed without knowing the true Reason why he was set on to
do them</i>. This is an Effort of good Nature which Sir <i>W. T.</i> little
imagined to receive at his Adversary's hand, and upon that score very
much questions the continuance of it. Perhaps, as was intimated
before, the Court might employ Sir <i>W. T.</i> in some Affairs, without
acquainting him with the true Grounds and Motives; and 'tis evident
Sir <i>W. T.</i> no where denies it. However if Mon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>sieur <i>de Cros</i> will so
far oblige him as to give him a true Light into those Matters, he
promises to receive it with all due Gratitude and Deference.</p>

<p><i>I came not by this Intelligence</i>, says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 9. <i>by
being a Counsellor of State to King Charles the II.</i> How then in the
name of Wonder came he by it? <i>But by having had the Happiness for
several years to possess no small room in the confidence of a certain
Minister, who has in several occasions of the last Importance been as
it were the</i> Primum Mobile <i>of that Conduct, which has surprized all</i>
Europe. 'Tis a scurvy Complement, this to the Memory of K.
<i>Charles</i> (whom for all that <i>de Cros</i> pretends still to honour) to
tell the World that Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> (for that is the first Letter
of this certain Minister's Name) an Ambassador of a foreign Prince,
and one engaged in Interests visibly opposite to those of <i>England</i>,
knew more of his Affairs than any of his own Subjects and
Privy-Counsellors. The whole Nation is indeed satisfied that our Court
was at that juncture too much influenced by <i>French</i> Councils; but few
will be brought to believe that the <i>French</i> knew more of our own
Affairs than we our selves did. By their Bribes and constant
Application to the Ministry then reigning we grant they might know as
much as we, but hardly more, unless it be proved that we did their
Business implicitly, just as Sir <i>W. T.</i> run through several
Negotiations for K. <i>Charles</i>, without knowing the Reasons and Grounds
of them. As we have already observed, 'tis no new thing for our mighty
Statesman to contra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>dict himself, and he does it <i>tr&eacute;s grossi&eacute;rement</i>
in this particular. Here he informs us that he owes all his
Intelligence to his frequent Conversations with Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>;
and a little below, where we shall, perhaps, examine this Matter more
carefully, we are told, <i>p. 29.</i> that this Ambassador came not to
<i>London</i> till several years after his Arrival there, and that then he
never maintain'd any Commerce with him <i>au prejudice de son devoir</i>,
i. e. to the prejudice of his Duty. Now how Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> as
Counsellor of State to King <i>Charles</i> the II. should be ignorant of
several important Affairs relating to that Prince, but as the
Confident of Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>, should be made acquainted with them,
and yet all this while preserve his <i>Duty</i> inviolate, is a
contradiction fit to be reconciled by no Man but the Party that made
it.</p>

<p>Having thus made it appear from whence he borrowed his Materials,
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> very gravely assures his noble Lord, <i>p. 11.</i> that
<i>after his death infallibly, and perhaps while he is alive</i> (for alas,
poor Gentleman, he never knew his own Mind above a quarter of an hour)
<i>his Memoirs shall appear in publick, and there he will discover
abundance of things the truth of which has been hitherto concealed
with so much Address and Dexterity</i>. Lord what an insufferable deal of
Impertinence and Noise have we already had about the intended Writings
of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>. First of all he promises, <i>p. 8.</i> to print a
Book of Remarks upon Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Memoirs, and this Book is to be at
least full as big as the Memoirs. In the second place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> <i>p. 9.</i> he
promises to visit the World with a Book of his own Memoirs, in which
(to see how strangely Children and Books do sometimes degenerate from
their Parents) there is to be neither one Word of Complaisance, nor
Flattery, nor the least grain of Passion. Nay what is more remarkable,
it shall reveal several important but hidden Truths; it shall unlock
the Cabinets of Princes; it shall turn <i>Whitehall</i> and <i>Versailles</i>
inside out, and in short come out with a hundred more Advantages than
ever any Book before it could boast off.</p>

<p>But what will you say to him, if after all this Parade and
Ostentation, he never publishes his <i>Memoirs</i>; for upon my Word the
thing is extremely doubtful. Can it be imagined that a Man of Monsieur
<i>de Cros</i>'s Christian Temper and Complexion will ever be accessary to
any Man's Ruine, but especially to that of a great Minister of State,
<i>who can be reproached with nothing in the World</i>, p. 12. <i>but only a
blind Obedience to the Will of the King his Master</i>? No, no, he is far
from pursuing the Destruction of any one, tho' never so great an Enemy
to him; and therefore since his Memoirs will most <i>infallibly</i> ('tis
his own Expression, <i>ibid</i>) produce so tragical an effect, there's no
Question but he may be easily prevailed with to suppress them. Besides
what may serve to confirm us farther in this Opinion, he solemnly professes,
<i>p. 12. that he still preserves a profound respect for the Memory of the
late King, and that he has a great regard for several Persons of Quality
who even at this time of day are deeply interested that he should</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
<i>hold his Tongue</i>. Now from hence I gather
that as 'tis impossible for him to write his Memoirs without being
somewhat familiar with the Reputation of King <i>Charles</i> the II. (and
if so, why does he quarrel with Sir <i>W. T. p. 38.</i> for <i>prostituting
that Prince's Reputation</i>, since by this passage 'tis apparent that a
Man cannot avoid the doing of it, provided he designs to write
sincerely) so 'tis probable that this Consideration may incline a Man
of his Compassion and Bowels to forbear the sacrificing a dead Monarch
to his Indignation; especially since it must be attended with the
unavoidable ruine of several eminent Persons still alive. Thus after a
due Examination of the Matter, I find 'tis a difficult Case to resolve
whether Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> will <i>infallibly</i> publish, or else
<i>infallibly</i> suppress his Memoirs.</p>

<p>If Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> designed this Letter as a Specimen of what he
shortly resolves to enrich the World with, he's extremely mistaken in
his Politics. To pretend it is an Answer to the Impostures of Sir
<i>W. T. R&eacute;ponse aux impostures de Monsieur le Chevalier Temple</i> (for
all this it threatens to perform in the Title Page) and yet not to
prove him faulty in one single Matter of Fact, but only in general
Terms to say he is frequently mistaken, which yet the best Man in the
World may be without deserving the Name of Impostor; and that care
shall be taken to satisfie him better at some other Opportunity, was
certainly the grossest and most absurd <i>Sol&#339;cism</i> in the World. But
not to dwell any longer upon this nauseous Chapter, I am sorry for my
Reader's sake,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> who it may be expected a more agreeable Entertainment,
that I have obliged my self to pursue Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> from
Paragraph to Paragraph: For Connexion being the least thing he
troubles his Head with, his Answerer, of Consequence, must be forc'd
to ramble along with him: But this being too late to be prevented now,
I return to him once more.</p>

<p><i>My Lord 'tis not my Design</i> (cries Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 13.)
<i>to write you a Letter full of Invectives against Sir</i> W. T. Now if
that were not his Design, he would very much oblige the World to let them
know at his first Convenience what it was. <i>Neither shall I descend
into the Particulars of his Conduct.</i> A wonderful great Favour! and
Sir. <i>W. T.</i> to show he is resolved not to be behind-hand with him in
Courtesie, promises by way of requital, never to trouble himself with
the Particulars of his. <i>I shall say no more at present than what is
barely necessary to convince your Lordship and all the World, that I
have the means in my hands to revenge my self abundantly for the
injuries he has done me.</i> To return a full Answer to this last period,
we need only put him in mind of the Proverb, <i>Canes timidi vehementi&ugrave;s
latrant quam mordent</i>, and much good may it do him.</p>

<p>The next Paragraph carries a very mournful Mien with it; for there he
complains that Sir <i>W. T.</i> set upon him first, that he writes with a
Spirit of Vengeance, that he suffers himself to be transported with
ungovernable Heats like a Man who fancies he is touch'd to the Quick:
But now mind what follows, <i>As for my self</i> p. 13. <i>I protest to you</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
<i>My Lord, that I write</i> de Sang Froid <i>in cold Blood</i>. How consistent
Writing in cold Blood and a hot Head is, I leave it to Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i> to determine at his Leisure. In the mean time an inconsidering
Man who sees such sort of Stuff so often repeated would imagine that
our <i>Letter-writer</i> had all the Meekness of a Primitive Saint, and
carried no such thing as a Gall about him; when 'tis plain, we may say
the same thing of his Gall, what some Physicians have observed of the
Liver in a vitiated Constitution, <i>crescente Liene decrescit reliquum
Corpus</i>; and that his has increased at the Expence of the rest of his
Body.</p>

<p>To be fully satisfied of the Truth of this, let us examine what
follows next. <i>'Tis true</i>, says Monsieur <i>du Cros</i>, p. 14. <i>that Sir</i>
W. T. <i>has glittered for some time, but then he borrowed all his
Lustre principally from the Protection of a certain Noble-Man whom at
last he betray'd, and of whom he makes insolent mention in his
Memoirs, and that with the blackest Ingratitude that may be</i>. This is
a very severe Charge, if it could be made out: But neither did Sir <i>W.
T.</i> derive all his Lustre from my Lord <i>A&mdash;&mdash;n</i>, nor does he treat him
insolently any where in his Memoirs. As soon as that Lord forsook his
Master's and the Kingdom's real Interests to cultivate the growing
Power of a Neighbouring Nation, Sir <i>W. T.</i> thought it high time to
leave him; but it never enter'd so much as into his Thoughts to betray
him. <i>After this</i>, continues our Pamphleteer, <i>he advanced
himself by the Patronage of some other Persons, to whose</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
<i>Service he intirely devoted himself, to the Prejudice of his Duty;
and so well did he insinuate himself into their Confidence and good Graces,
the Post he was in giving him the privilege to have a frequent Access to their
Persons, that he was in a Capacity to have rendred very considerable
Services both to the King his Master and to his Country if he had made
the best Use of that Advantage.</i> If Sir <i>W. T.</i> ever failed of doing
the best Offices he could for his King and Country, it might perhaps
proceed from want of better Information, but his Duty and Affection
were never in fault. This he thinks a sufficient Reply to this
ill-grounded Calumny; for he never dedicated himself so intirely to
the Service of other Persons (Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> must here mean the P.
of <i>O.</i>) as to make the least Infringement of his Allegiance. And this
will notoriously appear by several Passages in the Memoirs, but
particularly p. 153. where Sir <i>W. T.</i> gives a large Account of a long
Conversation between the P. of <i>O.</i> and himself in the Garden at
<i>Hounslerdyke</i>. The Prince had been telling him before, that the
Dispositions and Designs of the Court were generally thought so
different from those of the Nation, especially upon the Point of
Religion, that his Friends there did not believe the Government could
be long without some great Disturbance unless they chang'd their
Measures, which was not esteem'd very likely to be done. To which Sir
<i>W. T.</i> answered <i>That his Friends (as they pretended) in</i>
England <i>must see farther than he did to believe the King
in any such Dangers and Difficulties as they imagined.</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
<i>That the Crown of</i> England <i>stood upon surer Foundations
than ever it had done in former times, and the more for what
had passed in the late Reign; and that he believed the
People would be found better Subjects than perhaps the King himself
believ'd them. That it was however in his Power to be as well with
them as he pleased, and to make as short Turns to such an End; if not,
yet with the help of a little good Husbandry he might pass his Reign
in Peace, tho not perhaps with so much Ease at home or Glory abroad as
if he fell into the Vein of his People.</i> What could Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>
himself have done more in such a Station? Here was not the least
Injury design'd to the late King, and as for the other Part of Sir
<i>W. T</i>'s Discourse, his Obligations as well as Ties of Friendship to
the Prince necessitated him to give him a faithful Representation of
Affairs in <i>England</i>. But our furious Counsellor of State is still
inveighing against Sir <i>W. T. for being often deficient in an exact
Fidelity, which every Minister is obliged to preserve inviolably even
in Matters of the least Consequence</i>. Sir <i>W. T.</i> to his great Comfort
is not the first Minister that has sometimes made bold to disobey or
suspend his Masters Orders, by the same Token that there are the Names
of several upon Record, who after they have transgress'd upon this
Point, instead of Frowns or Punishments, have received Rewards from
their respective Princes as soon as they came to be better inform'd.
After all an implicite blind Obedience may do well in <i>France</i>, or
under a despotick Climate; but all the Application in the World will
never bring it to Perfection in <i>England</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>Well, but says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 15. <i>the late King of</i>
England <i>found him out at last, and was so sensible of it, that tho he
dispatch'd him with a Commission into</i> Holland, <i>he did it only out of
a Consideration of the Acquaintance he had there</i>. And a little lower,
<i>Nor was he then made use of but only in such Occasions as are never
devolv'd upon a Man with whose Conduct and Trust a Prince is well
satisfied, or for whom he has any regard and esteem; a Truth owned and
acknowledged by Sir</i> W. T. <i>himself in his Memoirs</i>. If Sir <i>W. T.</i>
had half the Vanity that makes so large a Share in the Composition of
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, he has here a fine Opportunity to tell the World
what particular Confidences his Prince reposed in him; but as this can
be no News to his Friends in <i>England</i>, so he does not esteem it worth
the while to proclaim it to Foreigners, some of whom perhaps are too
much prejudiced against him to receive any thing in his Behalf. 'Tis
true indeed, that Sir <i>W. T.</i> frequently takes notice in his Memoirs
of the many Marches and Counter-Marches of our Court, as he had just
Reason to do, and as all <i>Europe</i> observed as well as he. However he
must humbly beg Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s Pardon, if he cannot believe that
they were done with any Design to <i>prostitute</i> him to the World: For
if that were true, he thinks they carried on their Revenge too far,
and instead of prostituting his Character did but prostitute their own
more effectually.</p>

<p><i>And thus it is visible</i>, continues Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>
p. 16. <i>that the King, a little after the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
<i>Peace of</i> Nimeguen <i>neglected him</i>. If making Offers
to him of a Secretary's Place immediately after his
Arrival, be the Sign of Neglect, all this is certainly true; <i>and
seldom employ'd him. 'Tis not as Sir</i> W. T. <i>would make the World
believe, the Love of Retirement, and his Indisposition of Body, that
made him throw up his Employs; for never Man more passionately desir'd
to have his Share in the Publick Administrations than he.</i> Well, 'tis
no Miracle however to see a Man who is perfectly so unacquainted with
his own Humour to be a Stranger to all the rest of Mankind. The Author
of the Memoirs was at this time prevailed with by the King to have a
Part in a New Constitution of Council; and after almost two years
unsuccesful Endeavours at some Union, or at least some Allay of the
Heats and Distempers between the King and his Parliaments, took up a
Resolution of having no more to do with affairs of State; and
accordingly sent his Son in 1680. to acquaint his Majesty with it.
Whether he has departed from these Resolutions since, he leaves it to
the World to judge.</p>

<p>After Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has throughly chafed himself by assigning, as
he pretends, the true Reason why Sir <i>W. T.</i> was discarded the Court,
namely, the King's being dissatisfied with his Services, and Sir
<i>W. T</i>'s endeavouring all that in him lay to frustrate the King's
Commands, contained in a Dispatch which our <i>Letter-writer</i> left with
him at the <i>Hague</i>, as he was going to <i>Nimeguen</i> by his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> Majesty's
Order, to conclude a Peace <i>Don't expect</i>, says he p. 17. <i>My Lord,
that I should here acquaint you with the true Cause of so
extraordinary a Resolution, which according to Sir</i> W. T. <i>entirely
changed the Fate of Christendom. I should do him too great a Pleasure
if I should reveal so important a Secret, and several other Intrigues,
in which some Persons, both of the late and this Reign in</i> England,
<i>are nearly concerned.</i> But two or three Pages above, Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i> spoke in another Tone, <i>je lui fair ai le plaisir de le mieux
instruire</i>, p. 9. but now the Weather-Glass is alter'd with him, so
that, for all I can discover, we must e'en tarry till his Remarks, or
his Memoirs are printed, and till then blunder in the Dark. 'Tis true,
he is pleased to give a very pleasant reason why he is by no means for
opening his Raree-show at present, which the Reader may take in his
own Words; <i>I doubt not</i>, cries he, p. 18. <i>but Sir</i> W. T.
<i>passionately desires it; he knows well enough that a full Discovery of
these Practises would incense the Parliament against the Advisers of
them; and 'tis their Ruin he wishes at the Bottom of his Heart</i>. And a
little lower, <i>Besides, I would not at this critical Conjuncture, when
K.</i> William <i>labours with so much Zeal and Glory to procure the Repose
of Christendom, and the Happiness of his own Subjects, revive those
Animosities and Quarrels which have already occasioned but too many
Convulsions in</i> England, <i>and might be a great obstacle to that Union,
which is so necessary towards the happy Execution of the Designs of this great</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<i>Monarch</i>. Most Authors have their <i>le Fort</i> and <i>le Foible</i>;
but this Discourse of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> is altogether made up of
<i>Foibles</i>. For him to imagine that the great Senate of <i>England</i>
has nothing else to do but to read his Books and be directed by them,
is such a horrid piece of Vanity that nothing can parallel. No,
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> may safely print his Book, and yet for all that K.
<i>William</i> with his Confederates may re conquer <i>Flanders</i>, the
Parliament supply the King with Money, and not so much as one single
Courtier be sent to Grass. And this is so certain a Truth, that he
needs not be in a moment's pain about it; for if his Memoirs are no
more regarded in <i>England</i> than his Letter has been, he can injure no
man living by them, but, (as we have already told him) <i>himself</i> and
his <i>Bookseller</i>.</p>

<p>Well, at last, (Heaven be prais'd) we are come to the Merits of the
Cause; and now it appears that the true and real Cause why Monsieur
<i>de Cros</i> has all along so vehemently declaimed against Sir <i>W. T.</i>
proceeded not from his giving a wrong Relation of State-Affairs, from
his disturbing the Sacred Ashes of King <i>Charles</i> the Second, from his
neglecting to execute his Master's Orders, from his inexcusable
Ingratitude to his Protector and Patron, or, in fine, from his Pride,
his Opiniatret&eacute;, or any crime of that Nature. 'Tis a Thing of a nearer
Relation, and of a deeper Concern. He had injuriously attacked the
Reputation of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and now he must expect to be severely handled for it.</p>

<p><i>At this time</i>, says our incensed Statesman, p. 19. <i>there arrived
from</i> England <i>one</i> de Cros, <i>as Sir</i> W. T. <i>has express'd it, I shall
not, my Lord, make any stop at this term of Contempt, One de Cross</i>;
tho to his great Commendation be it spoken, he has almost spent a
whole Page about it before he has done, <i>'tis in Relation to my self
an Expression of the blackest Malice</i>. From thence he takes the Hint
to be speak himself to his Reader, telling him that the late King of
<i>England</i> did him the Honour to treat him with more Respect and
Civility, both in his Pass-ports, his Letters, and the Commissions he
entrusted him with. He says 'twas <i>fort Cavalierement</i>, in plain
English, impudently done to speak after that saucy manner, of a Man
that was born of a tolerable good Family, that had been honour'd near
twenty years with several Employments, and whom a great Prince and a
King did not disdain to take for a Counsellor of State. There is a
certain Figure in Rhetorick (I have forgot the Name of it) which the
Grammarians tell us we are guilty of committing, when we pretend to
pass over those very things which we design to enumerate; and this I
find has been very serviceable all along to Monsieur <i>de Cros; he
won't make any stop at those words, no, not he; he won't rake into the
Particulars of Sir</i> William'<i>s Life, no not he</i>, but all the
while does it; and to say the truth, there's nothing in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
whole Rhetorick that he copies with so good a Grace. Well, let all Authors for
the future, as they hope to avoid Sir <i>W. T</i>'s sad Destiny, whatever they
do, be sure to mind their Heraldry; for they may see what a terrible
Adversary he has drawn upon himself by making a small mistake in that
ancient and honourable Science.</p>

<p>The Author of the Memoirs, <i>p. 325.</i> giving a short account of
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> and his Character, was so ill advised as to throw
out these Words: <i>He had formerly been a</i> French <i>Monk, and some time
since had left his Frock for a Petticoat</i>. And now 'tis worth the
while to observe what judicious Remarques our furious <i>Letter-Writer</i>
has made upon them. <i>This is a fine reproach</i>, says he, <i>p. 20. to
come out of the Mouth of a Protestant Ambassador, one that belonged to
a Monarch who stiles himself Defender of the Faith; and in short, one
that so loudly declared at</i> Nimeguen <i>that he'd have nothing to do
with the Pope's Nuncio.</i> A very hard Case this, that Sir <i>W. T.</i> shall
not have the liberty to acquaint the World that Monsieur <i>de Cros had
been a Monk</i>, because, forsooth, his Master was Defender of the Faith:
Nor to take notice that <i>he had exchanged his Frock for a Petticoat</i>,
because he would not shake hands with the Pope's Nuncio at <i>Nimeguen</i>.
This is a strange sort of reasoning, but not very terrible. But
perhaps the Apology that follows may make some amends for the whipp'd
Cream above. <i>I don't know, my Lord, whether it is a scandalous</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<i>thing to be a Monk, this I am certain of, that it is infinitely less
scandalous to have been one.</i> Sir <i>W. T.</i> will never contradict
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> upon this Article, nor did he say in his Memoirs
that 'tis scandalous to be a Monk: But Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, who values
himself much upon his Politics, seeing he was unable to carry on the
War much longer at his own Expence, was resolved to fight his Battles
with the whole Body of the Regular Ecclesiastics; and therefore making
it a Cloister Quarrel, indicts him upon a <i>Scandalum Monachorum</i>. But
to proceed, <i>I make no doubt</i>, continues he, <i>but that among the Monks
as well as among the rest of Mankind, one may find sad wretched
Fellows</i>, (Speak softly lest any of the Brothers of the Surcingle hear
thee) <i>of mean, base Parentage</i>, (Prethee for your old Acquaintance
sake, not so loud) <i>of infamous, irregular Lives</i> (nay, now you have
undone yourself with them for ever) <i>Drones, good for nothing</i>, (I
find he'll never have done with this Chapter) <i>without Honour, Good
Manners, or Reputation</i>. And yet not a quarter of an hour agoe it was
no scandal to be in such blessed Company. <i>Sir</i> W. T. <i>without
Question looked upon me to be one of this number.</i> This is more than
he knew; but however since he has positively asserted it, Sir <i>W. T.</i>
will not contradict him. <i>But then</i>, says our <i>Furioso</i>, turning the
Tables, <i>p. 21. there are also to be found among them Persons
illustrious for the Sanctity of their Manners, Men of extraordinary
Merit, and of the highest Quality,</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
<i>Sons of Princes and of Crown'd
Heads, nay, Kings themselves, and Sovereign Pontiffs</i>. He is now
thinking to cajole the Monks after he had so plentifully bespatter'd
them before: And must fain let the World see how dexterously he can
blow Satyr and Panegyrick with the very same Breath. <i>But if this sort
of Life is not reckoned now a days, as it has been heretofore, so
certain a Character of an honest good Man does Sir</i> W. T. <i>imagine he
dishonours me, when he says that for a Petticoat I have abandoned a
Profession which he himself looks upon to be so contemptible.</i> If Sir
<i>W. T.</i> has not dishonoured Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, why all this Fury,
this Heat and Indignation? All that the Author of the Memoirs said was
very harmless. As an Historian he was obliged to give a short Account
of those persons, whose Actions he there recounts. Mr. <i>de Cros</i>
happening to be a Man very remarkable towards the conclusion of the
Treaty of <i>Nimeguen</i>, Sir <i>W. T.</i> acquaints the World with part of his
History, and in particular says he had been formerly a Monk. Nor does
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> deny it, and yet for all that fansies himself
abominably injured. What! because he reported him to have been of that
Profession of Life which has bred so many learned Men, furnished the
Almanack with so many Saints, Thrones with so many Kings; nay, and the
Pontifical Chair with one third of her Popes?&mdash;&mdash;But some people I see
are never well, full nor fasting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. <i>Dryden</i>, I remember, amongst several other judicious Remarks that
so frequently occur in his <i>Essay upon Dramatick Poetry</i>, has this of
the famous <i>Johnson</i>, which in my Opinion (and I think I have not lost
all my Taste in my Old Age) is admirable. <i>Ben</i>, says he, never
introduces any Person upon the Stage, but first of all informs his
Reader of his Character, and by that means bespeaks his attention. As
for instance if a <i>La fool</i> is to be brought in, he makes a Foot-boy
till <i>True wit</i>, that one Monsieur <i>La-fool</i> is coming to pay him a
Visit; and before he makes his appearance, <i>True-wit</i> lets his Friends
know, and consequently, by them, the Audience, what sort of a
Gentleman <i>La-fool</i> is, and what are his best Qualities. By this
ingenious Piece of Conduct the Poet takes care to please his
Spectators, who it may be are at first as uneasie to see a strange
Face upon the Stage, as in Company at the Tavern, till they are better
acquainted with his Dispositions; and then his Conversation is always
more edifying. The same management has been used by several Historians
(and not to descend into a <i>detail</i> of the rest) by <i>Sallust</i> himself,
a Writer of the first Rank and Quality: And why Sir <i>W. T.</i> should not
practise it, is certainly a Mystery. If then the Matter of Fact be
true (nor dares <i>de Cros</i> deny it) where's the Imposture? If the Truth
that is told does no ways reflect upon the Reputation of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> Party
concerned (as he himself owns it) where's the Injury, where's the
Affront?</p>

<p>Indeed as a famous <i>Grecian</i> Philosopher is reported thus to have
express'd himself in relation to his Thoughts of Humane Life, That it
was much better not to have been born than to live at all: So in
relation to the Monastick State, one may say without breach of
Charity, that it is (at least as the Sentiments of the World run now)
far preferable not to have been a Monk, than sometimes to have been
one: For though 'tis no scandal to wear a Cowl, I am sure there's no
Credit got by wearing it. In all such large Societies, the number <i>des
miserables, d'une basse naissance, gens inutiles, sans honneur &amp; sans
reputation</i>, are ten to one in comparison of the <i>tres celebres par la
Santet&eacute; de leur m&#339;urs, d'un merite extraordinaire</i>, &amp;c. And so much
in answer to Monsieur <i>de Cros's Princes</i> and <i>Kings</i>, <i>Cardinals</i> and
<i>Popes</i>.</p>

<p><i>I will not here tell you</i>, says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 21. <i>how I
came to be engaged in this Life in my younger Days</i>. Truly that is
somewhat hard. <i>Neither will I tell you the Reasons why I quitted it.</i>
This is the hardest of all: For though we may allow Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>
to have gone into a Convent for little or no reason at all; yet 'tis a
very severe Case if a Man of his Kidney had not several good Reasons
to leave it: His Youth excuses the former; but he was certainly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> at
Years of Discretion, when he abdicated the Monk, and set up the
Lay-man. But let us comfort our selves. The Memoirs will be printed,
and then we shall know all.</p>

<p>However though Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> at this present Writing would not
acquaint his Noble Lord with the Reasons of his Change; yet he is so
far complaisant as to satisfie him that <i>it was not for a Petticoat:
Ce ne fut pas au moins pour une juppe</i>, p. 21. And then he gives an
admirable Reason for what he says. <i>I passed several Years without
having any Inclinations to a Petticoat</i>. A pretty Argument; and
therefore a Petticoat was not the cause of his Change. But as the
Schoolmen say, <i>Quod primum in intentione, ultimum in executione</i>: And
so in the present Case, a Petticoat might be the first thing in
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s Intention, though it happened to be the last in
Execution. <i>Nay it appeared to the World</i>, p. 22. <i>that I was very
irresolute and difficult in my Choice</i>. And who can blame him for it.
The Matrimonial Vow is infinitely a greater Curb than the Monastick. A
man if he can make Friends with the Pope may get himself absolved from
the latter; or in case of Necessity, may turn his own Pope, as
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> did: But a Wife is not to be discarded at that
easie rate. 'Tis not the old Gentleman with the Cross-Keys and
Triple-Crown, but with the Scythe and Hour-glass that can free a Man
from his Spouse, and set him at liberty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><i>I had too much Advantage on my side</i>, p. 22. <i>to change the Frock for
the Petticoat I have chose, not to do it.</i> Well this plain Consession
makes amends for all. What was pretended a little before, <i>viz.</i> That
<i>some Years were passed before I had any Inclinations to a Petticoat</i>,
was spoke by the Politician: But here the true, the sincere, the
undebauched Monk speaks, who owns he would have taken up a Petticoat
much sooner, but only was looking sharp out all this while for one
that was well fringed with <i>Advantages</i>. And now as there are
abundance of Husbands in the World, who as soon as their Wives happen
to be mentioned in Company, cannot forbear to enlarge upon their
several Perfections and Vertues; so it fares with Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>,
for now he is got into his <i>Petticoat</i>, he will never have done. <i>'Tis
a Petticoat</i>, continues he, <i>d'une &eacute;toffe d' Ecosse, of Scotch Cloth,
which has been of far greater Ornament and Service to the Crown of</i>
England, <i>than even Sir</i> W. T. himself. Since his Petticoat has done
such rare Exploits, by my Consent let Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> write a
Panegyrick upon it. But by the bye this is a very figurative way of
Writing; and therefore, though I don't understand it, I hope there may
be some meaning in the bottom. <i>If he does not know so much already</i>,
p. 26. <i>the History of the last Transactions in</i> England <i>and</i>
Scotland <i>will better inform him.</i> Here we are referr'd again to a
<i>Hans en Kelder</i> of a History, which when it will be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
mid-wifed into the World the Lord knows. But I wonder extremely why he wou'd
condescend so low to compare his useful Petticoat to Sir <i>W. T.</i> as
why in another place <i>p. 8.</i> he tells us that the <i>Dutch</i> Minister who
forwarded the Triple-League, surpassed Sir <i>W. T.</i> in Prudence. A very
sorry Complement this, both to his serviceable Petticoat and to his
prudent <i>Dutch</i> Minister, if as he pretends, <i>p. 62.</i> Sir <i>W. T.</i> was
taken abroad <i>pour dupe</i>, for a Cully.</p>

<p><i>I will not say any more of this Matter</i>, continues Mounsieur <i>de
Cros</i>, p. 22. <i>because I have no mind to engage my self to publish the
Misfortunes and Disorders of Sir</i> W. T'<i>s Family</i>. Methinks he might
have left out Disorders, for Misfortunes is enough; <i>and that in my
Opinion wou'd not be fair and honest</i>. Why the bare mention of a
Petticoat should engage him in such a Narration, is hard to conceive;
and yet this blind Insinuation is infinitely more malicious than if he
had wandered into a large History. There the World would have been
satisfied what these Misfortunes were, with which Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>
so brutally refreshes Sir <i>W. T</i>'s memory; whereas this blind
<i>Innuendo</i> leaves open room for the Conjectures and Surmises of all
people, who in such Cases generally imagine the worst. <i>I have no
Occasion</i>, says he, <i>that I know of, to complain either of his Wife,
his Son, or his Daughters</i>; why then all these invidious Hints? Is it
not enough for other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> Persons to condemn our Author, but must he pass
Sentence upon himself.</p>

<p><i>But suppose</i>, says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, p. 23. <i>that I had quitted the
Frock, for the Petticoat, what of all that? 'Tis no more than what an
infinite number of Persons of eminent Worth, such as Nuncio's,
Bishops, Cardinals, Kings, and Popes have done in their time: Nay,
there have been some Princesses in the World that have changed a Veil
for a pair of Breeches, whose Posterity I don't question are held in
great Veneration by Sir</i> W. T. All this may very well be; and yet I
cannot but observe how natural it is for your great Persons to excuse
themselves by the Example of their great Predecessors. And thus the
poor Ant in the Epigram that unfortunately tumbled down the Precipice
of a Mole-hill, comforted her self with the Precedent of <i>Phaeton:
'Tis true</i>, says she, <i>I have had a damn'd Fall here; but what then?
Sic cecidit Phaeton</i>, Phaeton <i>had one before me</i>.</p>

<p><i>If I had been a sort of an Agent for Sweden</i>, says Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i>, p. 24. <i>as Sir</i> W. T. <i>has represented me, I should not have
defended my self upon that score; I should have taken it for a great
Honour to be employed by so mighty a King</i>. I wonder then where was
the hurt if Sir <i>W. T.</i> conferr'd a <i>Swedish</i> Agentship upon him. <i>But
at that time I was at the Court of</i> England <i>in Quality of
Envoy-Extraordinary from the Duke of</i> Gottorp, <i>whom Sir</i> W. T.
<i>never so much as mentions in his Memoirs, although he had two Ministers at the</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>Congress, and</i> France <i>stipulated for his re-establishment in the
second Article of the Peace</i>. By Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s leave, the Agent
was some Years older than the Envoy; and if Sir <i>W. T.</i> has omitted
the Duke of <i>Gottorp</i> in his Memoirs, 'twas pure Forgetfulness, but
not want of respect. <i>Well</i>, concludes he, in a great Fit of Devotion,
<i>p. 26. Heaven be praised Sir</i> W. T. <i>is not the Dispenser of Glory
and Immortality</i>. And Heaven be likewise praised, say I, Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i> is not the Dispenser of Scandal and Ignominy.</p>

<p>Sir <i>W. T.</i> in his Memoirs, <i>p. 335.</i> speaking of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>,
happen'd to let fall this short particular. <i>At</i> London <i>he had
devoted himself wholly to Monsieur</i> Barillon, <i>the</i> French
<i>Ambassador, though pretending to pursue the interests of</i> Sweden.
Upon this Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> raises a furious Outcry, and to furnish
himself with a better pretence of complaining of his unjust usage, as
he imagines, he has quite perverted the meaning as it lies in the
Original: For whereas Sir <i>W. T.</i> barely says, that he devoted himself
to the Service of the <i>French</i> Ambassador at <i>London</i>, without
specifying any time at all, Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has translated it, <i>Des
qu'il avoir &eacute;t&eacute; &agrave; Londres</i>, that is, <i>ever since he came to</i> London;
and thereupon informs his Reader that Monsieur <i>Barillon</i> was not at
<i>London</i> when he was sent thither, but the Marquis <i>de Ruvigny</i>, who
was afterwards succeeded by Monsieur <i>de Courtin</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
By this piece of <i>Fourberie</i>, to give it no worse a Name, he thought
to have eluded the severe, but just imputation cast upon him by Sir
<i>W. T.</i> of being one of <i>Barillon</i>'s Creatures, but with what Success
any unprejudiced Reader may see. For,</p>

<p>Observe what he says in the next Paragraph. <i>I never devoted my self
to that Ambassador</i>, p. 29. <i>and never maintained any Correspondences
with him to the prejudice of my Duty.</i> As just before Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i>, with an ingenuity peculiar to himself, had made Sir <i>W. T.</i>
speak what he never designed, in order to invalidate his Testimony; so
here, forgetting it seems what he had formerly advanced, he gives
himself the Lye. There is no doubt but every man may make as bold with
his own Reputation as he pleases, but then this gives him no Privilege
to invade that of his Neighbour: and therefore Sir <i>W. T.</i> though he
allows Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> the liberty to contradict himself as often
as he in his great Wisdom sees fit, and easily forgives him that
Offence; yet he desires him for the future not to commit the same
violence upon others.</p>

<p>It may very pertinently be demanded what Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> means by
these Words, <i>to the prejudice of his Duty</i>: For a man that pays so
small a regard to Truth, as he seems to do, perhaps, may think nothing
in the World an infringement of his Duty. But let us hear him explain
himself upon this Chapter. <i>I confess, indeed</i>, p. 30. <i>that when he</i>,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
meaning Monsieur <i>Barillon, employ'd himself for the Interests of
my Master, and of</i> Sweden, <i>I became intirely devoted to him</i>. At last
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> owns himself to be devoted to Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>;
however to mollifie it somewhat, he pretends that he never made those
Advances till that Ambassador cultivated the Interests of his Master
and of <i>Sweden</i>. A miserable Evasion! for how perfidiously the
Ministers of that Crown have all along dealt with their Allies, let
<i>Candy</i> and <i>Messina</i> proclaim to the World. Their Friendship has been
fatal to all that ever depended upon it, as the Histories of the last
Times will evidently show; and though they pretended never so
cordially to espouse the Quarrel of their Confederates, yet they
seldom scrupled to abandon their Interests when it made never so
little for their Advantage to do it.</p>

<p><i>How this Dispatch by</i> de Cros <i>was gained, or by whom</i> (says Sir <i>W.
T.</i> in his Memoirs, <i>p. 336.</i>) <i>I will not pretend to determine.</i> And
a little lower: <i>The Account I met with at Court was, that these
Orders were agreed and dispatched one morning in an hours time, and in
the Dutchest of</i> Portsmouth'<i>s Chamber by the intervention and pursuit
of Monsieur</i> Barillon. In this place Sir <i>W. T.</i> by no means
pretends, to decide the Question, but only relates what were the
general Sentiments of the Court upon it, and for the Truth of this,
appeals to several eminent Persons still living. But it is pleasant to
observe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> what a learned Harangue Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has made upon this
Account. <i>'Tis a great deal of pity</i>, says he, <i>p. 35. that an
Ambassador of</i> England, <i>who had the Secretary's place so often
proffer'd him, was not only during his absence, when he was
negotiating the Publick Affairs at</i> Nimeguen <i>and the</i> Hague,
<i>but even at his return into</i> England, <i>so little instructed in
what had passed there, and principally in an Affair of this Importance and
Consideration.</i> Perhaps 'tis a great deal of pity, as he says; but by
his favour 'tis no wonder at all, especially considering the
Constitution of our Court at that juncture, that when they were to
play any private Game, they never thought it worth their while to
acquaint Sir <i>W. T.</i> with their Intrigues; nor does he envy the good
Fortune of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> for being made a Party in them.</p>

<p><i>What a horrid Impertinence</i>, adds our Declaimer, <i>p. 38. was it in
him to endeavour to perswade the World, that the most important Affair
of that time, on which according to him, the Fate and Destiny of</i>
Christendom <i>depended, was dispatched and concluded in an hour's time
in the Dutchess of</i> Portsmouth'<i>s Apartment by the Intervention of
Monsieur</i> Barillon. We may well allow Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> to Christen
Truth by the Name of Impertinence, because he's so seldom guilty of
such Impertinences; and his Memoirs when they visit the World,
whatever Faults they may be charged with, will be never liable I
believe to that Exception. Sir <i>W. T.</i> as has been already said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> only
delivers this as the Opinion of the Court, without interposing his own
Sentiments: And indeed to any unprejudiced Person, who considers what
an unfortunate influence that Ambassador in conjunction with the
Mistress had upon the late King, this Account will not appear so
<i>impertinent</i> as Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> represents it.</p>

<p>Sir <i>William Temple</i>, continues Monsieur <i>de Cros, p. 38. according to
his Custom, so little regards the Reputation of his King, that he
makes no scruple to prostitute it upon this Occasion after the
strangest manner in the World.</i> Nor is this sufficient, but with his
usual vehemence and fury he attacks Sir <i>W. T. for representing the
King of</i> England, <i>obliged so much as he was by his Quality of
Mediator, and much more by the Interest of his Kingdoms, to procure
repose to</i> Christendom, <i>as corrupted by the Ambassador of</i> France,
<i>and by the Charms of his Mistress, sacrificing all</i> Europe <i>and his
own Dominious to a Power naturally an Enemy to</i> England: <i>and this
hand over-head, at an hour's warning, without the advice of his
Council, lock'd up in a Woman's Apartment, as if he had been sensible
that he was going to do an Action, the most unworthy the Majesty of a
Prince, and the most opposite to the Happiness of his people</i>. What a
profound respect Sir <i>W. T.</i> pays to the memory of that Monarch, as he
knows best himself; so let his own Works speak for him, and
particularly his Memoirs, since Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> has reflected so
severely upon that Book,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> where the Reader may find the following
Character, p. 273. <i>I never saw him in better humour, nor ever knew a
more agreeable conversation when he was so; and where he was pleased
to be familiar, great quickness of Conception, great pleasantness of
Wit, with great Variety of Knowledge, more Observation and truer
Judgment of Men than one would have imagined by so careless and easie
a manner as was natural to him in all he said or did. From his own
temper he desired nothing but to be easy himself, and that every body
else should be so; and would have been glad to see the least of his
Subjects pleased, and to refuse no man what he asked.</i> And a little
below; <i>Sure no Prince has more Qualities to make him lov'd, with a
great many to make him esteem'd, and all without a Grain of Pride or
Vanity in his Constitution; nor can he suffer Flattery in any kind,
growing uneasy upon the first Approaches of it, and turning it off to
something else. But this Humour has made him lose many great Occasions
of Glory to himself, and Greatness to his Crown, which the
Conjunctures of his Reign conspired to put into his Head, and have
made way for the aspiring Thoughts and Designs of a neighbouring
Prince, which would not have appeared, or could not have succeeded in
the World without the Applications and Arts imployed to manage this
easy and inglorious Humour of the King's.</i> The Reader will certainly
forgive this long Citation, since now he is able to judge for himself,
whether of the two holds the Memory of King <i>Charles</i> the Second in
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> greatest Reverence, Sir <i>W. T.</i> who has drawn this true but
tender Character of him, or Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>, who out of a Pretence
of borrowing it out of the Memoirs, has made the above-mentioned
invidious Representation of that excellent Prince. If there is any
thing severe in Sir <i>W. T</i>'s Character 'tis towards the latter end;
however, 'tis managed with all Decency of Language, and the Truth of
it will serve to atone for the Plainness.</p>

<p>But now behold a new Occasion of Quarrel, upon this Passage in Sir
<i>W. T</i>'s Memoirs, p. 336. <i>the King indeed told me pleasantly, that
the Rogue</i> de Cros <i>had out-witted them all</i>. To which Monsieur <i>de
Cros</i> replies, p. 43. that if Sir <i>W. T.</i> had not made the King speak
these Words, but had said them himself, he would apply to him with as
much Justice as to any man in the World, these Verses, which he had
somewhere read,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Coquin, ce me dit il, d'un arrogance extreme</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Va Cherchir les coquins ailleurs, coquin toi-mem&ecirc;.</i></span></p>

<p>Which may be thus rendred into <i>English</i>,</p>

<p><span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>He calls me a Rogue, like an arrogant Elf,</i></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>Seek your Rogues, Friend, at home, you're a great one your self.</i></span></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>
<p>By the Pointedness of the Conceit one would be apt to imagine that
this noble Distich was of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s Composition, and indeed
'tis but fit that an Author who shews himself so phlegmatick in his
Prose, should have the same dull Genius attend him in Poetry. But be
the Verses whose they will, the merit of the Application intirely
belongs to our <i>Letter-Writer</i>, who, to his Praise be it spoken,
discreetly chose out two of the dullest Lines in the Universe, which
it was impossible for him to murder, even by his own dull way of
applying them.</p>

<p>After a long Discussion of the matter, he finds he is not so much hurt
as he imagined at first. For in the first place he observes that the
King called him <i>Coquin</i> or <i>Rogue</i> pleasantly, by way of Jest and
without Passion; and in the second place, that if he called him so on
purpose and with Design, yet he ought not to wonder at it, p. 47.
since it was so usual a Compliment with him, and he had treated not
only the most flourishing Republick in the World, <i>Holland</i>, and two
Ambassadors of his most Christian Majesty, the Count <i>d'Avaux</i> and
Monsieur <i>Barillon</i>, but even some Members of Parliament who had
presented him with an Address, by this familiar Term. And here I
cannot but make two Remarks; 1. That Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> does not
preserve that profound Respect for the Memory of King <i>Charles</i>, as he
would make the World believe; and that he makes no Conscience to
sacrifice that Prince's Reputa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>tion upon every trivial Occasion, where
himself is concern'd to vindicate his own No-Reputation. 2. That as we
took Notice before, our great <i>Letter-writer</i> still takes pains to
justify himself by the Protection of great Names. Thus, if Monsieur
<i>de Cros</i> was a Monk, several Princes, and Kings, and Cardinals, and
Popes were so before him; and if he deserted his Frock for a
comfortable Petticoat, 'tis no more than what Nuncio's, and Pontiffs,
and Persons of the highest Quality had shown him a President for: Thus
if K. Charles the Second call'd him a Rogue, it never mortifies him;
for according to our Author, he bestowed that very same Compliment
upon Parliament-Men, Ambassadors, nay the States of <i>Holland</i>: and in
like manner if he was Author of the abovemention'd dull Distich, he
may still comfort himself by the Example of <i>Tully</i>, of <i>Nero</i>, nay
and of <i>Augustus</i> himself.</p>

<p><i>I need not put my Invention to the rack</i>, says Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> p.
49. <i>to revenge my self on Sir</i> W. T. <i>If I had been minded to call
Falshood to my Assistance, I should have bespattered him with bitterer
things: but the Truth of my Remarks upon his Memoirs will revenge me
sufficiently upon him.</i> 'Tis needless here to question the
fruitfulness of Monsieur <i>de Cros</i>'s Invention, he having given but
too many Proofs of it in this short Letter; and were it not that
Dulness is the chief Ascendent in his Temper, he has variety enough of
<i>Fable</i>, to qualify him not for a Writer of Remarks, but a Poet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span> In
short if the dreadful Volume he threatens Sir <i>W. T.</i> with, perform no
greater Execution than this little Specimen, Sir <i>W. T.</i> will have all
the Reason in the World to bless his kind Stars for sending him so
harmless an Adversary.</p>

<p>Our Author who found it so necessary to engage other Persons in his
Quarrel, summs up all his Malice in his last Effort. Says he, p. 56.
<i>This the most proud and vindicative of all kind, has in his Memoirs
assaulted the Reputation even of the greatest Ministers, as the Duke
of</i> Lauderdale, <i>the most zealous and faithful Servant
the King ever had</i>; (by the same Token that
a<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>
late Pamphlet has recorded a celebrated Saying of his, <i>viz.</i> that he
hoped to see the King's Edicts to be Laws and above the Laws) <i>My
Lord</i> Arlington <i>who had brought him out of Dust and Oblivion to place
him in Employments</i>; (but this Article having been cleared already, I
shall now dismiss it without any further Remark) <i>The principal
Ministers and sagest Magistrates of</i> Holland, <i>the present Earl of</i>
Rochester, and <i>the Marquis of</i> Carmarthen. If this were true, as 'tis
apparently false, they don't want the Help of such a feeble Writer as
Monsieur <i>de Cros</i> to defend them. Lastly, p. 61. <i>Perhaps, says he,
this great Minister, this great Confident of Kings and Princes, and only
Preserver of</i> Flanders, <i>had done wiser than to enter the Lists with a
Monk, with a sort of an agent and a cunning Rogue</i>. To all which let this
short Answer serve. Sir <i>W. T.</i> had it never in his intentions to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
enter the Lists with an Enemy of so prostitute a Character; he only mention'd
him two or three times, <i>en passant</i>, and has other Business to employ
him, than to engage himself in a War where he can Expect no Triumph.</p>
